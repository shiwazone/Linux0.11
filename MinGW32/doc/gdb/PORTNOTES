  GNU GDB port to MingW32
  Version: gdb-6.3-1

1) Please check the doc/gdb/PORTPATCH for the patch details. This patch
   is a mix of the 5.2.1 and new additions by me. Contact me for details
   of what I have added or any updates.
2) The readline support in 6.3 is readline version 4.3. The 4.2 patch has
   been updated to 4.3. The low level keyboard code has been rewritten to
   support control and meta characters. The 4.2 patch assumes a specific
   memory layout and this made the patch fragil.
3) I have add a tcp target. No gdbserver exists for MinGW yet. The remote
   tcp target is for cross compiled targets that can support the remote
   target. The patch includes changes to GDB to better support non-POSIX
   hosts by a cleaner layering of the remote/async code.
4) A bug exists in this patch for cross compiler TCP support. The 
   configure script does not supply the -lwsock2 library. This will be
   fixed in the next release.
5) This patch will not support Insight. It will apply, build but will
   not run. I am working on this as a background task. The issue is
   GDB's uses of setjmp/longjmp and TCL on Windows using threads. This
   does not mix. On top of this SEH makes the the GDB event loop look
   fragile. The resulting patches to GDB do not seem worth the effort and
   if I maintained GDB would not accept them.
6) The patch includes a fix to the MingW32/Cygwin common win32-nat.c code.
   I testing a bug report against this release I noticed hitting 'r'un again
   resulted in low level errors. I tracked the errors to the thread handle
   being reused and the restart code closing attached threads from the last
   process and so closing the new handle. Also the DLL support was tring to
   clean up after the process has gone.
*) Report bugs to mingw-users@lists.sf.net first for this port release.
*) These changes have yet to be submitted for review.
